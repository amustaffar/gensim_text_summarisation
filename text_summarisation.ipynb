Derivatives can cause a Fund to become leveraged. Leverage occurs when exposure to an \\narea invested in is greater than its amount invested, resulting in the Fund being exposed to a potentially greater loss than the initial investment.\\n• The Fund may use derivatives to reduce costs, overall risk and/or generate additional capital or income. This is known as Efficient Portfolio Management \\n(EPM). When used for EPM purposes, there should not be an increase in the overall risk level of the Fund.\\n• More political, economic or structural challenges face emerging markets or less developed countries than developed countries which may increase volatility \\nand uncertainty.\\n• Where investments are in the shares of companies (equities), the value of those equities may fluctuate, sometimes dramatically, in response to the \\nactivities and results of individual companies or because of general market and economic conditions or other events.\\n• Investment in other funds may mean that the objectives and risk profiles of those underlying funds may not (always) be fully in line with those of the Fund.\\n• The price of units/shares and any income from them may fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Past performance is \\nnot a guide to future performance. There is no assurance that the investment objective of the Fund will actually be achieved.\\n• Significant exposure to a particular industrial sector or geographical region puts the fund at risk of a localised event making a significant impact on the \\nvalue of the Fund.\\n• The price of gold/natural resources in which the Fund invest may be subject to sudden, unexpected and substantial fluctuations that may lead to significant \\ndeclines in the values of the shares concerned and hence the Net Asset Value of the Fund.\\n\\nAll the risks currently identified as being applicable to the Fund are set out in the 'Risk' section of the Prospectus.\\n\\nKey Investor Information\\n\\nObjectives and Investment Policy\\n\\nThe Fund will seek to do this by investing a large proportion in:\\n\\n• UK equities listed on the FTSE-All-Share Index;\\n\\nThe Fund will also invest in:\\n\\n• UK gilt-edged securities; \\n• global bonds;  \\n• overseas equities; \\n• units in collective investment schemes; and \\n• investment trusts.  \\n\\nApproved derivatives transactions may be used only for the purpose of efficient portfolio management (including hedging).\\n\\nThe Fund will decide how investments are weighted based on market conditions.\\n\\nIn certain circumstances pooled funds will be invested in, either through unit trust or ETF structures.
